1. create new file for each new math problem question
1.1 all math problems should be inside the problems folder
1.2 for the naming use all lowercase with _ bettween the words and do not use spaces in the names.
2. **Format**: All files are Markdown (.md)
3. **Equations**: LaTeX format required:
   - Math samples inline: use single dollar signs (`$P_u = q_u \times A$`)
   - Equations standalone: use double dollar signs (`$$...$$`) on their own line with no text before or after
   - Equations can span multiple lines for matrices and complex expressions
4. **Trigonometry Cheat Sheet**: When any trigonometry formula, identity, or relationship appears in a problem, check if it exists in `fundamentals/trigonometry_cheatsheet.md`. If it's missing, add it to the cheat sheet automatically without asking the user.
