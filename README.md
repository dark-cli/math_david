## 📚 Dirty Problems Collection

A collection of 214 problems extracted from `the_dirty_file.pdf`. Problems are numbered sequentially from `problem_1.md` to `problem_214.md`.

### Categorized Problems

- **[Categorized Problems](./dirty_problems_categorized.md)**
  - Complete categorization of all 214 problems organized by:
    1. **Lecture Order** - Following the sequence: Vector Algebra → Vector Functions → Gradient/Divergence/Curl → Line Integrals
    2. **Difficulty Level** - Easy, Medium, Hard classifications
    3. **Shared Concepts** - Grouped by common mathematical ideas
  - Organized into 4 main parts:
    - **Part I:** Vector Algebra and Basic Operations
    - **Part II:** Vector Functions and Derivatives
    - **Part III:** Gradient, Divergence, Curl, and Laplacian
    - **Part IV:** Line Integrals
  - Includes study guide by difficulty level and statistics
  - Exam coverage: Vector Analysis (Chapter 1) through Line Integrals (Chapter 2), excluding Green's Theorem

Each file follows the naming convention `problem_N.md` where N is the problem number. See [INSTRUCTIONS.md](./dirty_problems/INSTRUCTIONS.md) for processing guidelines.

## 📋 Rules and Guidelines

See [rules.md](./rules.md) for the complete set of formatting and organizational rules.

Key guidelines:
- **File Organization**: Each problem gets its own file in the appropriate folder
- **Naming Convention**: All lowercase with underscores, no spaces
- **Format**: All files are Markdown (.md)
- **Equations**: LaTeX format required
