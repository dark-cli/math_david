# Gradient, Divergence and Curl

## The Del Operator (∇)

The vector differential operator $\nabla$ (del), is defined by:

$$\nabla = \vec{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \vec{j}\frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \vec{k}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$$

This vector operator possesses properties analogous to those of ordinary vectors. It is useful in defining three quantities which arise in practical applications and are known as the **gradient**, the **divergence** and the **curl**.

## 1. Gradient

Let $\phi(x, y, z)$ be defined and differentiable at each point $(x, y, z)$ in a certain region of space (i.e., $\phi$ defines a differentiable scalar field). Then the **gradient** of $\phi$ is defined by:

$$\text{grad } \phi = \nabla\phi = \left(\vec{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \vec{j}\frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \vec{k}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right)\phi$$

Expanding:

$$\nabla\phi = \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial x}\vec{i} + \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial y}\vec{j} + \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial z}\vec{k}$$

## Interpretation of Gradient

An interesting interpretation is that if $\phi(x, y, z) = c$ is the equation of a surface, then $\nabla\phi$ is a normal to this surface.
