# Geometric Interpretation of a Vector Derivative

## Position Vector and Space Curves

If $\vec{r}$ is the vector joining the origin $O$ of a coordinate system and the point $(x, y, z)$, then specification of the vector function $\vec{r}(u)$ defines $x$, $y$ and $z$ as functions of $u$.

As $u$ changes, the terminal point of $\vec{r}$ describes a **space curve** having parametric equations:

$$x = x(u), \quad y = y(u), \quad z = z(u)$$

## Unit Tangent Vector

If the parameter $u$ is the arc length $s$ measured from some fixed point on the curve, then:

$$\frac{d\vec{r}}{ds} = \frac{dx}{ds}\vec{i} + \frac{dy}{ds}\vec{j} + \frac{dz}{ds}\vec{k} = \vec{T}$$

$\vec{T}$ is a unit vector in the direction of the tangent to the curve and is called the **unit tangent vector**.

## Velocity and Acceleration

If $u$ is the time $t$, then:

- $\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$ represents the **velocity** $\vec{v}$ with which the terminal point of $\vec{r}$ describes the curve.
- $\frac{d^2\vec{r}}{dt^2}$ represents its **acceleration** $\vec{a}$ along the curve.

## Displacement Vector

For a small change $\Delta u$ in the parameter:

$$\Delta\vec{r} = \vec{r}(u + \Delta u) - \vec{r}(u)$$

This represents the displacement vector between two points on the curve, where $\Delta s$ is the corresponding arc length along the curve.
