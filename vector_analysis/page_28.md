# Simple Closed Curves and Connected Regions

## Simple Closed Curves

A **simple closed curve** is a closed curve which does not intersect itself anywhere.

**Examples:**
- A circle is simple
- An irregular smooth closed loop (bean-shaped) is simple
- A figure-eight shape is **not simple** (it intersects itself)

## Simply and Multiply Connected Regions

If a plane region has the property that any closed curve in it can be continuously shrunk to a point without leaving the region, then the region is called **simply connected**, otherwise it is called **multiply connected**.

**Examples of simply connected regions:**
- Interior of a circle
- Exterior of a circle

**Example of multiply connected region:**
- The area between two concentric circles

## Positive Direction

The **positive direction** around a closed curve is defined as the direction in which an observer would move if he traversed the curve in such a way that the area of $R$ was always on his left.

**According to this definition:**
- If $R$ is the interior of a simple closed curve $C$, then the positive direction around $C$ is the **counter-clockwise** direction.
- If $R$ is the region exterior to a simple closed curve $C$, then the positive direction around $C$ is the **clockwise** direction.
