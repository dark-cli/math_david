# Chapter 1: Vector Analysis

## Definition of a Vector

A vector is defined as a directed line segment $\overrightarrow{PQ}$ from one point $P$ called the "initial point" to another point $Q$ called the "terminal point."

Vectors are denoted by bold faced letters or letters with an arrow over them.

The "magnitude" or "length" of the vector is denoted by $|\overrightarrow{PQ}|$.

## Vector Algebra

### 1. Equal Vectors

Two vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ are "equal" if they have the same magnitude and direction regardless of their initial points. Thus $\vec{A} = \vec{B}$ in the figure above.

**Note:** Two parallel vectors with the same magnitude and direction are equal, even if they start at different points.

### 2. Negative Vector

A vector having direction opposite to that of vector $\vec{A}$ but with the same magnitude is denoted by $-\vec{A}$.

**Note:** The negative vector has the same length as the original vector but points in the opposite direction.
