# Vector Functions

## Definition

If corresponding to each value of a scalar $u$ we associate a vector $\vec{A}$, then $\vec{A}$ is called a "function of $u$" denoted by $\vec{A}(u)$.

We can write:

$$\vec{A}(u) = A_1(u)\vec{i} + A_2(u)\vec{j} + A_3(u)\vec{k}$$

## Extension of Function Concept

The function concept is easily extended. Thus, if to each point $(x, y, z)$ there corresponds a vector $\vec{A}$, then $\vec{A}$ is a function of $(x, y, z)$ indicated by:

$$\vec{A}(x, y, z) = A_1(x, y, z)\vec{i} + A_2(x, y, z)\vec{j} + A_3(x, y, z)\vec{k}$$

## Vector and Scalar Fields

A vector function $\vec{A}(x, y, z)$ defines a **vector field** since it associates a vector with each point of a region.

Similarly, $\phi(x, y, z)$ defines a **scalar field** since it associates a scalar with each point of a region.

## Limits, Continuity and Derivatives of Vector Functions

### 1. Continuity

The vector function $\vec{A}(u)$ is said to be **continuous** at $u_0$ if given any positive number $\epsilon$, we can find some positive number $\delta$ such that:

$$|\vec{A}(u) - \vec{A}(u_0)| < \epsilon \quad \text{whenever} \quad |u - u_0| < \delta$$

This is equivalent to the statement:

$$\lim_{u \to u_0} \vec{A}(u) = \vec{A}(u_0)$$
