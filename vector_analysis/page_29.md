# Green's Theorem in the Plane

## Statement of Green's Theorem

Let $P$, $Q$, $\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}$, $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}$ be single-valued and continuous in a simply-connected region $R$ bounded by a simple closed curve $C$. Then:

$$\oint_C [P \, dx + Q \, dy] = \iint_R \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) dx \, dy \tag{2.8}$$

where $\oint_C$ is used to emphasize that $C$ is closed and that it is described in the positive direction.

## Extension

This theorem is also true for regions bounded by two or more closed curves (i.e., multiply-connected regions).

## Physical Interpretation

Green's Theorem relates a line integral around a closed curve to a double integral over the region enclosed by the curve. It is a special case of Stokes' Theorem in two dimensions.
