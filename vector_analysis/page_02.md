# Vector Addition, Subtraction, and Scalar Multiplication

## 3. The Sum or Resultant of Vectors

The "sum" or resultant of vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ is a vector $\vec{C}$.

To find $\vec{C} = \vec{A} + \vec{B}$:
- Place the initial point of vector $\vec{B}$ at the terminal point of vector $\vec{A}$
- Draw $\vec{C}$ from the initial point of $\vec{A}$ to the terminal point of $\vec{B}$

This is known as the **triangle rule** for vector addition.

## 4. The Difference of Vectors

The "difference" of vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$, denoted as $\vec{A} - \vec{B}$, is the vector $\vec{C}$ which, when added to $\vec{B}$, gives $\vec{A}$.

Alternatively, $\vec{A} - \vec{B}$ can be defined as $\vec{A} + (-\vec{B})$.

## 5. Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar

Multiplication of a vector $\vec{A}$ by a scalar $m$ produces a new vector $m\vec{A}$ whose:
- **Magnitude:** $|m\vec{A}| = |m| \cdot |\vec{A}|$ (absolute value of $m$ times the magnitude of $\vec{A}$)
- **Direction:** 
  - Same as $\vec{A}$ if $m > 0$
  - Opposite to $\vec{A}$ if $m < 0$

## Unit Vectors

**Definition:** Unit vectors are vectors having a length of one (unit length).

**Finding a Unit Vector:** If $\vec{A}$ is any vector with length $|\vec{A}| > 0$, then the expression $\frac{\vec{A}}{|\vec{A}|}$ represents a unit vector that has the same direction as $\vec{A}$.
