# Problem 132: Continuation of Work Done Calculation

## Problem Statement

This page contains continuation of calculations for work done without friction, showing the final steps.

## Solution

### Final Calculation

From the previous page, using the coordinate transformations:

$$W = \int K(xdx + ydy)$$

For the path $y = 1 + x^2$ from $(0,1)$ to $(1,2)$:

$$W = K\int_0^1 [xdx + (1+x^2)(2xdx)]$$

$$= K\int_0^1 [3x + 2x^3]dx$$

$$= K\left[\frac{3}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4\right]_0^1 = 2K$$

## Answer

$$\boxed{W = 2K}$$
