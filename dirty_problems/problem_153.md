# Problem 153: Continuation of Triangle Line Integral

## Problem Statement

This page contains continuation of calculations for the line integral around a triangle, showing the final simplification steps for segment 3.

## Solution

### Final Calculation for Segment 3

From the previous page, the integral simplifies to:

$$\int_2^0 \frac{25}{2}y \, dy = \left[\frac{25}{4}y^2\right]_2^0 = -25$$

### Total Result

Summing all three segments:

$$\int_C [(2x-y+4)dx + (5y+3x-6)dy] = 21 + 16 - 25 = 12$$

## Answer

$$\boxed{12}$$
