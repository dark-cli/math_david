# Problem 130: Continuation of Work Done Calculation

## Problem Statement

This page contains continuation of calculations for work done by a force proportional to the cube of distance, showing the final steps.

## Solution

### Final Calculation

From the previous page:

**Segment 1:** From $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$:

$$W_1 = K\int_0^1 x^3 dx = \frac{1}{4}K$$

**Segment 2:** From $(1,0)$ to $(1,1)$:

$$W_2 = K\int_0^1 (y + y^3)dy = \frac{3}{4}K$$

**Total:**

$$W = W_1 + W_2 = \frac{1}{4}K + \frac{3}{4}K = K$$

## Answer

$$\boxed{W = K}$$
