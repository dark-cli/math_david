# Problem 146: Continuation of Line Integral Evaluation

## Problem Statement

This page contains continuation of calculations for evaluating line integrals, showing the final steps for part (c).

## Solution

### Part (c): Final Calculation

From the parametric equations $x = 2t$, $y = t$, $z = t$:

The integral simplifies to:

$$\int_0^1 [2t + 6 + 3t^2]dt$$

$$= \left[t^2 + 6t + t^3\right]_0^1 = 1 + 6 + 1 = 8$$

## Answer

$$\boxed{8}$$
