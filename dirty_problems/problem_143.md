# Problem 143: Continuation of Work Done Calculation

## Problem Statement

This page contains continuation of calculations for the work done by a force field, showing the final steps for parts (b) and (c).

## Solution

### Part (b): Final Calculation

From the previous page, the integral simplifies to:

$$\int_0^1 [48t^5 + 16t^4 + 28t^3 - 12t^2 + t]dt$$

$$= \left[8t^6 + \frac{16}{5}t^5 + 7t^4 - 4t^3 + \frac{1}{2}t^2\right]_0^1 = \frac{71}{10}$$

### Part (c): Final Calculation

From the substitutions $y = \frac{1}{4}x^2$ and $z = \frac{3}{8}x^3$:

The integral evaluates to:

$$\left[x^3 - \frac{1}{32}x^4 + \frac{51}{384}x^6\right]_0^2 = \frac{16}{3}$$

## Answer

**Part (b):**

$$\boxed{\frac{71}{10}}$$

**Part (c):**

$$\boxed{\frac{16}{3}}$$
