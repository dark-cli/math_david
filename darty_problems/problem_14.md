# Problem 14: Find Image of Circle Under Linear Transformation

## Problem Statement

Find the image of the circle $|Z| = 2$ in the $z$-plane if it is mapped under the transformation $W = Z + 3 + 2i$.

## Solution

### Step 1: Express Transformation in Terms of Real and Imaginary Parts

Let $W = U + iV$ and $Z = X + iY$.

The transformation is:
$$W = Z + 3 + 2i$$

Substituting:
$$U + iV = X + iY + 3 + 2i$$

Grouping real and imaginary parts:
$$U + iV = (X + 3) + (Y + 2)i$$

### Step 2: Equate Real and Imaginary Parts

$$U = X + 3$$
$$V = Y + 2$$

### Step 3: Express X and Y in Terms of U and V

$$X = U - 3$$
$$Y = V - 2$$

### Step 4: Substitute into the Circle's Equation

The original circle is $|Z| = 2$, which means:
$$X^2 + Y^2 = 4$$

Substitute the expressions for $X$ and $Y$:
$$(U - 3)^2 + (V - 2)^2 = 4$$

### Step 5: Interpret the Result

The equation $(U - 3)^2 + (V - 2)^2 = 4$ represents a circle in the $W$-plane with:
- Center at $(3, 2)$
- Radius $2$

## Answer

The image of the circle $|Z| = 2$ under the transformation $W = Z + 3 + 2i$ is a circle in the $W$-plane with center at $(3, 2)$ and radius $2$.

The equation is:
$$(U - 3)^2 + (V - 2)^2 = 4$$

$$\boxed{(U - 3)^2 + (V - 2)^2 = 4}$$
